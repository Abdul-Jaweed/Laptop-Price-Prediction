# Flipkart Laptop Price Prediction

## Flipkart Laptop Data - Business Insights on Product Pricing

Flipkart is an Indian e-commerce company that was founded in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal (not related). The company is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and initially started as an online bookstore before expanding to other categories such as electronics, fashion, and home goods.

In 2018, Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart for $16 billion, making it the largest ever acquisition by Walmart. As of 2021, Flipkart is one of the leading e-commerce companies in India and competes with other major players such as Amazon and Reliance JioMart.


## Problem Statement

Elon Musk has started his own laptop company (Tesla Laptop) in India. He wants to give tough fights to big companies like Apple, Alienware, HP etc.

                       ![elon boi](https://github.com/Abdul-Jaweed/Laptop-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Images/elon.PNG)

He does not know how to estimate the price of laptops his company creates. In this competitive laptop market you cannot simply assume things. 

Musk wants to find out some relation between features of a Laptop(eg:- RAM, OS,  etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Data Mining. üò•

To solve this problem he already asked his Data Engineering team (from Twitter üê•ü§≠) to collect laptop data from various competitors.

Now he needs your (i.e Data Scientist‚Äôs) help to solve the following problem. ü•∞



# Sprint - 1 (Data Analysis and Mining)

## Musk‚Äôs Requirements

- Build an interface (using streamlit) for Elon Musk where he can enter the laptop features like RAM Size, RAM Type, HDD, OS, etc. and get the price prediction.

- Based on your Data Analysis and MIning skills, give recommendations to Elon Musk on how the pricing works in the laptop market.

# Sprint - 2 (ML Model Tuning)

Congratulations! Elon Musk is happy with your models and insights that you have shared in the previous requirements. 

Now he wants you to test the models you have created for Underfitting and Overfitting. He wants you to build a best fit model.

## Todo - 

 - First try to check if the models you have created are a best fit or not.
 - See if applying cross validation helps improve your models performance.
